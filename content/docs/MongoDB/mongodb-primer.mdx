## Databases

Method of storing structured information that is efficient and persistent. Managed by a database management system (DBMS) that supports the following operations (often called CRUD):

- **Create**: adding new data
- **Read**: retrieving data
- **Update**: changing data
- **Delete**: removing data

### SQL Databases

Often called Relational Databases. Data is stored in tables with rows and columns. Preferred for consistency, complex queries, and strong relationships.

Example table (Users):

| id | name   | email              |
|----|--------|--------------------|
| 1  | Lance  | lpu@umd.edu        |
| 2  | Aryan  | bob@email.com      |
| 3  | Justin | immortal@umd.edu   |

### Document Databases

Data is stored in JSON-like documents. Preferred for flexibility, evolution, irregular data, horizontal scaling. 

Example document (User):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@email.com",
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "notifications": true
  }
}
```

### Other Database Types

- **Key–Value Stores** – Data stored as `{key: value}` pairs, great for fast lookups and caching (e.g., Redis)
- **Column-Family Stores** – Data organized by columns for large-scale analytics and time-series (e.g., BigQuery)
- **Graph Databases** – Data modeled as nodes and edges, optimized for relationships (e.g., Neo4j)
- **Vector Databases** – Store and search high-dimensional vectors for ML applications (e.g., Pinecone)
