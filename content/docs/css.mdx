## Tailwind
* Instead of writing lots of separate CSS rules, you use little pre-built classes right in your HTML, like ```bg-blue-600``` for a blue background or ```p-4``` for padding.
* ``@apply``: lets you bundle a bunch of the mini Tailwind classes into a single custom class in your CSS file, saving you from repeating the same list everywhere—like creating a .card class from a handful of style rules
* Commands like ``duration-300`` set the speed of an animation or transition to 300 milliseconds. 

## Recap 
* Responsive design/layout handled using Flexbox and responsive utility preferences. 
* Using common patterns such as using ``@apply`` helps keep code maintainable.
* CSS is always referenced as a static file from Flask, with the correct structure for static serving.
* Most styling work in the p3 and p4 repos use Tailwind CSS utilities directly in HTML templates.
