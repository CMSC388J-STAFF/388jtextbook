This course is an introduction to building full-stack applications with Python and Flask. We'll start with the basics of building apps with Python and Flask, then transition to user and database management with MongoDB. Then, we'll go into other topics, and finish by showing you how to deploy your web app with Vercel. You'll end the class with a fianl project where you build and deploy your own Flask application from scratch.
