## Creating Forms

Why do we need forms? 



Forms allow for two primary things: 
* Users to enter data into our website
* Process the user input into something meaningful/valuable

<details>
  <summary>What HTML tag is used to create a form on a web page?</summary>
  <p> the \<form> tag </p>
</details>



Form handling is made easy through the Flask-WTF package, which integrates Flask and WTForms. 



```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        return process_form()
    else:
        return render_template(...)
```


## Cross-Site Forgery (CSRF) Attacks


Not everyone is a good person (shocker). 



## Validating Forms


```python
pip3 install Flask-WTF
```


An example: 



```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, IntegerField
from wtforms.validators import InputRequired, NumberRange, Length

class WelcomeForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField('Name', validators=[InputRequired(), Length(min=4, max=30)])
    location = StringField('Location', validators=[InputRequired(),
    Length(min=3, max=50)])
    age = IntegerField('Age', validators=[InputRequired(), NumberRange(min=1, max=140,
    message='Must be between 1 and 140')])
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')
```
