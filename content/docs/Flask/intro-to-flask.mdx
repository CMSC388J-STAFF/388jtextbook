## What is Flask?

Flask was created by Armin Ronacher. It combines HTML/text rendering and handling web requests by gluing together the libraries of Jinja and Werkzeug.

Flask is referred to as a micro-framework, meaning that using its core functionality to make a web application is relatively simple process as compared to other full-stack frameworks (such as Django). Extended functionalities such as authentication and database management are not in Flask by default but are provided through extensions.
Think "small core, big ecosystem."

## Routing

### Adding More Pages

Our website just has a singular "Hello World" now. We can create more pages using the same syntax and file:

```python
@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'Calling from CMSC388J<br>I\'m learning Flask!'
```

Here, we apply two decorators to `hello_world` to create two routes that both point to `hello_world`.

### Variable Routing

Useful web applications typically feature many users, posts, etc., far too many to write out manually. We can apply variable routing to handle this:

```python
@app.route('/')
def info():
    return 'Append "user/{username}" to the end of the url to go to <i>username</i>\'s page'

@app.route('/u/<username>')
def show_profile(username):
    return f'This is {username}\'s user profile'
```

Now, we have a countably infinite amount of routes: `/u/lance`, `/u/aryan`, `/u/chuck`, etc.

<Callout> The order of the variables in the decorator and function must match! Flask matches by position rather than by name.</Callout>

## Templating


### render_template() and url_for()
