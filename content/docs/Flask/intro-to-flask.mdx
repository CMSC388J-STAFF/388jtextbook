## What is Flask?

Flask was created by Armin Ronacher. It combines HTML/text rendering and handling web requests by gluing together the libraries of Jinja and Werkzeug.

Flask is referred to as a micro-framework, meaning that using its core functionality to make a web application is relatively simple process as compared to other full-stack frameworks (such as Django). Extended functionalities such as authentication and database management are not in Flask by default but are provided through extensions.
Think "small core, big ecosystem."
