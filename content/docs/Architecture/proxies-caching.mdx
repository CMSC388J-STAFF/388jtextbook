## When can we cache?

Short answer: Websites or pages with many reads and relatively few writes. 

### Long Tail of Reads

Consider the distribution of traffic on Wikipedia:

- A small fraction of Wikipedia pages are popular and account for most of the traffic.
- There is a *long tail* of pages that are rarely accessed - most of these won't be in our cache.

In general, websites or pages that have a lot of centralized reads are easy to cache.

### Writes and Expiration

What do we do when cached data changes, and is returned to clients out-of-date? Three solutions:

1. Expire cache entries after a certain **TTL (time to live)**.
2. When data is edited, send new data or an invalidation message to all caches-a **Coherent Cache**.  
3. Don't change your data, and instead create new files for new data-**versioned data**.

This helps, but websites or pages that are frequently written to are more difficult to cache.

  <summary>Is the President of the United States' Wikipedia page useful to cache?</summary>
  <div style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
    <p>Easy to cache because it is popular. Hard to cache because the data changes frequently.</p>
  </div>
</details>

## HTTP Caching

[HTTP's statelessness](/docs/Architecture/rest-design-practices#statelessness) allows us to respond to repeated requests with the same response. `GET` requests in partciular are cached very easily, unlike `DELETE`, `POST`, or `PUT`, which modify data and generally aren’t cached.

HTTP includes a `Cache-Control` header that allows us to specify how to use HTTP's cache:

- `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` - Control expiration time (TTL).
- `Cache-Control: only-if-cached` - Only serve request if we have the response cached.
- `Cache-Control: no-cache` - Serve the request using server and database response.

## Review

We introduced **proxies** and **caching**.

- **Proxies** are the intermediaries for handling requests, e.g. caches or load balancers.
- **Caches** are proxies that store data useful for future requests, before they even reach our servers.

We also discussed how caching can be useful for read-heavy services, and controlling caches in HTTP.

Here is a final overview of the Wikipedia architecture we've been discussing-try to answer the questions given:
