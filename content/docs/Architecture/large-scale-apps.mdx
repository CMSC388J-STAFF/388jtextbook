## Scalable Architecture

For this course, we built applications with exactly one web server instance (Flask) that connects to a database provider (MongoDB). However, most applications in industry look closer to this:

### What does "scaling" mean?

> Scalability is the ability of a service to grow to handle many concurrent users (ideally an arbitrarily large number).

There are two ways to scale an application, broadly:

- **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)** - Upgrading your machine. CMSC132 and CMSC216.
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)** - Adding more machines.

| Aspect | Vertical Scaling | Horizontal Scaling |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Ease of Development | Easy - already supported by most software | Harder - requires communication |
| Performance | Okay - modern servers can have ~96 cores | Fast - handles very large workloads |
| Replacements | Bad - single point of failure | Good - redundant nodes |
| Cost Efficiency | Bad - requires expensive hardware | Good - allows for cheap hardware |
| Scalability Limit | Limited - eventually hits hardware ceiling | Virtually unlimited, with good design |

Tl;dr: Horizontal scaling is better, but is more complicated.

### Load Balancers

Load balancers take internet requests and routes the request to one of your web servers. 

Stateless servers are what make load balancing possible-see the slides on REST APIs.

### Scalable Databases

Data Sharding: spreading a database over horizontally scaled instances called "shards." Choose which database to store data in based on a hash function.

Replication: placing more than one copy of the same data.

Initial attempts: Facebook had one database instance per university, at one point.  

### In-Memory Caching 

Cache results of recent database queries within a key-value store.

Most notable implementations are Memcache and Redis. Caching is also performed on the internet itself via HTTP headers, and additionally performed via Content Distribution Networks (CDNs).
